## The Problem

Ever feel stuck on a coding problem, talking it out to yourself or an inanimate object (like a rubber duck)? Rubber Ducky provides a structured digital space to formalize that process, helping you break down complex issues systematically.

## What is Rubber Ducky?

Rubber Ducky blends a guided problem-solving framework with a simple diagramming canvas. It's designed to help you think clearly and document your thought process as you tackle technical challenges.

### The QUACK Framework  Mnemonic

At its core, Rubber Ducky uses the **QUACK** framework:

* **Q**uandary: Define the problem or question clearly. What are you trying to solve?
* **U**ncover: Brainstorm potential causes, constraints, assumptions, and gather relevant information. What do you know? What do you need to find out?
* **A**ctions: Outline the steps you will take to investigate or solve the problem. What will you try?
* **C**onclusions: Record the results of your actions. What did you learn? Did it work?
* **K**ey Takeaways: Summarize the solution, lessons learned, or next steps. What's the final outcome or insight?

### How it Works

1.  **Fill the Form:** Use the QUACK fields to structure your thoughts about a specific problem.
2.  **Draw it Out:** Use the adjacent canvas to visually represent concepts, workflows, or relationships related to your problem.
3.  **Save a "Quack":** Your current form input and diagram state are saved together as a "Quack" (like a digital post-it note) using your browser's Local Storage.
4.  **Revisit:** Click on any saved Quack in the list to instantly reload the corresponding form data and diagram onto the canvas.

## Target Audience

This tool is primarily aimed at software developers, engineers, designers, students, and anyone who benefits from a structured approach to debugging, planning, or understanding complex technical problems.

## Current Status

* The core functionality (QUACK form, diagramming, saving/loading Quacks via Local Storage) is implemented.
* The application is currently functional as a client-side tool using Local Storage (no backend database).
* Ongoing work is focused on improving the UI/UX design.

## Getting Started

Simply visit one of the live demo links above and start QUACKing! No installation is required.

1.  Describe your problem using the **Quandary** field.
2.  Flesh out details in **Uncover**, plan steps in **Actions**.
3.  As you work, draw on the **Canvas**.
4.  Record results in **Conclusions** and final thoughts in **Key Takeaways**.
5.  Click "Save Quack" to store your progress.
6.  Click a saved Quack in the list to load it back.
